In the context of Bangladesh, agriculture plays a major role in our food and economy. For agricultural development one of the key factors is the development of farmers. But the farmer development is happening very slowly. Our farmer is losing their passion for farming because of many factors. Now, they have banking loans, high-interest debt, or owe money to reduce their financial crisis. These solutions are complicated in terms of the farmer’s life. We can use diverse technology to optimize some major risks and maximize growth. That’s why we are suggesting a simple technological-based solution that can prepare our farmers for the ‘fourth industrial revolution’.
